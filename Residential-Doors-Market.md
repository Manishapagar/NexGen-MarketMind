Major trends during this period included:</p><ul> <li><strong>Increased Demand for Energy-Efficient Doors:</strong> Rising awareness about sustainability and energy efficiency led to a surge in demand for doors with better insulation properties. Manufacturers focused on developing doors that reduced energy consumption, in line with green building certifications and regulations.</li> <li><strong>Smart Technology Integration:</strong> The advent of smart homes saw an integration of smart locks and security systems into residential doors. Consumers increasingly preferred doors with biometric access, remote control features, and enhanced security capabilities.</li> <li><strong>Customization and Aesthetic Focus:</strong> Homeowners prioritized doors that matched their personal styles.
